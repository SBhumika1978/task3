    <p>Bootstrap (formerly Twitter Bootstrap) is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first
        front-end web development. It contains HTML, CSS and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography,
        forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.
    
        As of May 2023, Bootstrap is the 17th most starred project (4th most starred library) on GitHub, with over 164,000
        stars.[4] According to W3Techs, Bootstrap is used by 19.2% of all websites.[5]
    
        Features
        Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS and JS library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages (as
        opposed to web applications). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of
        color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether the developers in charge find
        those choices to their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style definitions for all HTML
        elements. The result is a uniform appearance for prose, tables and form elements across web browsers. In addition,
        developers can take advantage of CSS classes defined in Bootstrap to further customize the appearance of their
        contents. For example, Bootstrap has provisioned for light- and dark-colored tables, page headings, more prominent
        pull quotes, and text with a highlight.
    
        Bootstrap also comes with several JavaScript components which do not require other libraries like jQuery. They
        provide additional user interface elements such as dialog boxes, tooltips, progress bars, navigation drop-downs, and
        carousels. Each Bootstrap component consists of an HTML structure, CSS declarations, and in some cases accompanying
        JavaScript code. They also extend the functionality of some existing interface elements, including for example an
        auto-complete function for input fields.

        The most prominent components of Bootstrap are its layout components, as they affect an entire web page. The basic
        layout component is called "Container", as every other element in the page is placed in it. Developers can choose
        between a fixed-width container and a fluid-width container. While the latter always fills the width with the web
        page, the former uses one of the five predefined fixed widths, depending on the size of the screen showing the
        page:[6]</p>
